                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <P>Andrew is a free spirited individual with a contagious passion for nature and learning. I'm an aspiring <strong>Frontend Engineer</strong> who loves to learn, unlearn and relearn. Although the journey to becoming a software engineer seem to be a very long ride but I'm ready to put in the work and ensure I make a significant difference in the coming years.</P>
                <p> I'm a graduate of the university of lagos who studies Environmental Toxicology. However, this was not and has never been my passion and so I'm not practing in that field. I found interest in web developmet after my NYSC in 2020 but I couldn't continue with my learning because I had a lot going on.</p>

            <!-- REASON FOR JOINING ALTSCHOOL -->
            <section>
                <h2>Reason For Joining AltSchool</h2>
                <p>Throughout my upbringing, I've held a deep fascination for technology's potential, unaware that it was termed 'tech.' Entering this program, my knowledge of the tech realm was minimalâ€”I was a complete novice. My selection of ALT School over other options was rooted not only in my desire to excel as a software engineer but also in my aspiration for a seamless integration into the expansive tech industry. Recognizing ALT School as the ideal conduit toward this goal, I remain confident that my decision was the correct one, now that I've spent more than a month immersed in this program.</p>
